CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - FEBRUARY 2024

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent in February on a
seasonally adjusted basis, after rising 0.3 percent in January, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 3.2 percent before seasonal
adjustment.

The index for shelter rose in February, as did the index for gasoline. Combined, these two indexes
contributed over sixty percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items. The energy index
rose 2.3 percent over the month, as all of its component indexes increased. The food index was
unchanged in February, as was the food at home index. The food away from home index rose 0.1 percent
over the month.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.4 percent in February, as it did in January.
Indexes which increased in February include shelter, airline fares, motor vehicle insurance, apparel,
and recreation. The index for personal care and the index for household furnishings and operations were
among those that decreased over the month.

The all items index rose 3.2 percent for the 12 months ending February, a larger increase than the
3.1-percent increase for the 12 months ending January. The all items less food and energy index rose
3.8 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index decreased 1.9 percent for the 12 months ending
February, while the food index increased 2.2 percent over the last year. 



Table A. Percent changes in CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city average

Food

The food index was unchanged in February, as was the food at home index. Both of these indexes had
risen 0.4 percent in January. Three of the six major grocery store food group indexes decreased over
the month. The index for dairy and related products decreased 0.6 percent in February, led by a
1.1-percent decline in the index for cheese and related products. The fruits and vegetables index
decreased 0.2 percent over the month, as did the nonalcoholic beverages index. 

The index for cereals and bakery products rose 0.5 percent in February, following a 0.2-percent
decrease in January. The meats, poultry, fish, and eggs index also increased over the month, rising
0.1 percent. The index for other food at home was unchanged over the month.

The food away from home index rose 0.1 percent in February, after rising 0.5 percent in January. The
index for full service meals rose 0.1 percent, as did the index for limited service meals. 

The food at home index rose 1.0 percent over the last 12 months. The index for other food at home rose
2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in February, as did the index for nonalcoholic beverages. The
cereals and bakery products index increased 1.7 percent over that period. The index for fruits and
vegetables rose 0.8 percent over the 12 months ending in February. In comparison, the dairy and related
products index fell 1.8 percent over the year, and the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs index decreased
0.5 percent. 

The index for food away from home rose 4.5 percent over the last year. The index for limited service
meals rose 5.2 percent over the last 12 months, and the index for full service meals rose 3.8 percent
over the same period. 

Energy

The energy index rose 2.3 percent in February, after declining 0.9 percent in January. The gasoline
index increased 3.8 percent in February. (Before seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices rose 4.3 percent
in February.) The index for natural gas rose 2.3 percent over the month, and the index for electricity
rose 0.3 percent. The fuel oil index increased 1.1 percent in February.

Despite the monthly increase, the energy index fell 1.9 percent over the past 12 months. The gasoline
index decreased 3.9 percent, the natural gas index declined 8.8 percent, and the fuel oil index fell
5.4 percent over this 12-month span. In comparison, the index for electricity rose 3.6 percent over the
last year. 

All items less food and energy

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.4 percent in February, as it did the previous month.
The shelter index increased 0.4 percent in February and was the largest factor in the monthly increase
in the index for all items less food and energy. The index for rent rose 0.5 percent over the month,
while the index for owners' equivalent rent increased 0.4 percent. The lodging away from home index
increased 0.1 percent in February, after rising 1.8 percent in January. 

The airline fares index rose 3.6 percent in February, following a 1.4-percent increase in January. The
index for motor vehicle insurance increased 0.9 percent over the month. Among other indexes that rose
in February were apparel, recreation, and used cars and trucks.

The medical care index was unchanged in February after rising 0.5 percent in January. The index for
hospital services decreased 0.6 percent over the month and the index for physicians' services decreased
0.2 percent. The prescription drugs index fell 0.1 percent in February. The index for dental services
was among those that rose in February, increasing 0.4 percent.

The index for personal care fell 0.5 percent in February, following a 0.6-percent increase in January.
The household furnishings and operations index fell 0.1 percent over the month, as did the new vehicles
index. 

The index for all items less food and energy rose 3.8 percent over the past 12 months. The shelter
index increased 5.7 percent over the last year, accounting for roughly two thirds of the total 12-month
increase in the all items less food and energy index. Other indexes with notable increases over the
last year include motor vehicle insurance (+20.6 percent), medical care (+1.4 percent), recreation
(+2.1 percent), and personal care (+4.2 percent).

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 3.2 percent over the last 12 months
to an index level of 310.326 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index increased 0.6 percent prior to
seasonal adjustment.  

The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) increased 3.1 percent over
the last 12 months to an index level of 304.284 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index increased 0.7
percent prior to seasonal adjustment.  

The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) increased 2.9 percent over the last
12 months. For the month, the index increased 0.6 percent on a not seasonally adjusted basis. Please
note that the indexes for the past 10 to 12 months are subject to revision.

Technical Note

Brief Explanation of the CPI
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services.
The CPI reflects spending patterns for each of two population groups: all urban consumers and urban
wage earners and clerical workers. The all urban consumer group represents over 90 percent of the total
U.S. population. It is based on the expenditures of almost all residents of urban or metropolitan areas,
including professionals, the self-employed, the poor, the unemployed, and retired people, as well as
urban wage earners and clerical workers. Not included in the CPI are the spending patterns of people
living in rural nonmetropolitan areas, farming families, people in the Armed Forces, and those in
institutions, such as prisons and mental hospitals. Consumer inflation for all urban consumers is
measured by two indexes, namely, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the
Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U). The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is based on the expenditures of households included in the CPI-U
definition that meet two requirements: more than one-half of the household's income must come from
clerical or wage occupations, and at least one of the household's earners must have been employed for
at least 37 weeks during the previous 12 months. The CPI-W population represents approximately 30
percent of the total U.S. population and is a subset of the CPI-U population.

The CPIs are based on prices of food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation, doctors' and dentists'
services, drugs, and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. Prices are
collected each month in 75 urban areas across the country from about 6,000 housing units and
approximately 22,000 retail establishments (department stores, supermarkets, hospitals, filling
stations, and other types of stores and service establishments). All taxes directly associated with the
purchase and use of items are included in the index. Prices of fuels and a few other items are obtained
every month in all 75 locations. Prices of most other commodities and services are collected every
month in the three largest geographic areas and every other month in other areas. Prices of most goods
and services are obtained by personal visit, telephone call, web, or app collection by the Bureau's
trained representatives.

In calculating the index, price changes for the various items in each location are aggregated using
weights, which represent their importance in the spending of the appropriate population group. Local
data are then combined to obtain a U.S. city average. For the CPI-U and CPI-W, separate indexes are
also published by size of city, by region of the country, for cross-classifications of regions and
population-size classes, and for 23 selected local areas. Area indexes do not measure differences in
the level of prices among cities; they only measure the average change in prices for each area since
the base period. For the C-CPI-U, data are issued only at the national level. The CPI-U and CPI-W are
considered final when released, but the C-CPI-U is issued in preliminary form and subject to three
subsequent quarterly revisions.

The index measures price change from a designed reference date. For most of the CPI-U and the CPI-W,
the reference base is 1982-84 equals 100. The reference base for the C-CPI-U is December 1999 equals
100.  An increase of 7 percent from the reference base, for example, is shown as 107.000. Alternatively,
that relationship can also be expressed as the price of a base period market basket of goods and
services rising from $100 to $107. 

Sampling Error in the CPI

The CPI is a statistical estimate that is subject to sampling error because it is based upon a sample
of retail prices and not the complete universe of all prices. BLS calculates and publishes estimates
of the 1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month percent change standard errors annually for the CPI-U.
These standard error estimates can be used to construct confidence intervals for hypothesis testing.
For example, the estimated standard error of the 1-month percent change is 0.03 percent for the U.S.
all items CPI. This means that if we repeatedly sample from the universe of all retail prices using
the same methodology, and estimate a percentage change for each sample, then 95 percent of these
estimates will be within 0.06 percent of the 1-month percentage change based on all retail prices. For
example, for a 1-month change of 0.2 percent in the all items CPI-U, we are 95 percent confident that
the actual percent change based on all retail prices would fall between 0.14 and 0.26 percent. For the
latest data, including information on how to use the estimates of standard error, 
see www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/variance-estimates/home.htm. 

Calculating Index Changes

Movements of the indexes from 1 month to another are usually expressed as percent changes rather than
changes in index points, because index point changes are affected by the level of the index in relation
to its base period, while percent changes are not. The following table shows an example of using index
values to calculate percent changes:

                            Item A                  Item B                      Item C
Year I                      112.500                 225.000                     110.000
Year II                     121.500                 243.000                     128.000
Change in index points      9.000                   18.000                      18.000
Percent change              9.0/112.500 x 100 = 8.0  18.0/225.000 x 100 = 8.0   18.0/110.000 x 100 = 16.4

Use of Seasonally Adjusted and Unadjusted Data

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) program produces both unadjusted and seasonally adjusted data.
Seasonally adjusted data are computed using seasonal factors derived by the X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal
adjustment method. These factors are updated each February, and the new factors are used to revise the
previous 5 years of seasonally adjusted data. The factors are available at 
www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/seasonal-adjustment/seasonal-factors-2024.xlsx. For more information on data
revision scheduling, please see the Factsheet on Seasonal Adjustment at 
www.bls.gov/cpi/seasonal-adjustment/questions-and-answers.htm and the Timeline of Seasonal Adjustment
Methodological Changes at www.bls.gov/cpi/seasonal-adjustment/timeline-seasonal-adjustment-methodology-changes.htm. 

How to Use Seasonally Adjusted and Unadjusted Data

For analyzing short-term price trends in the economy, seasonally adjusted changes are usually preferred
since they eliminate the effect of changes that normally occur at the same time and in about the same
magnitude every year-such as price movements resulting from weather events, production cycles, model
changeovers, holidays, and sales. This allows data users to focus on changes that are not typical for
the time of year. 

The unadjusted data are of primary interest to consumers concerned about the prices they actually pay.
Unadjusted data are also used extensively for escalation purposes. Many collective bargaining contract
agreements and pension plans, for example, tie compensation changes to the Consumer Price Index before
adjustment for seasonal variation. BLS advises against the use of seasonally adjusted data in
escalation agreements because seasonally adjusted series are revised annually for five years.

Intervention Analysis

The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses intervention analysis seasonal adjustment (IASA) for some CPI
series. Sometimes extreme values or sharp movements can distort the underlying seasonal pattern of
price change. Intervention analysis seasonal adjustment is a process by which the distortions caused by
such unusual events are estimated and removed from the data prior to calculation of seasonal factors.
The resulting seasonal factors, which more accurately represent the seasonal pattern, are then applied
to the unadjusted data.

For example, this procedure was used for the motor fuel series to offset the effects of the 2009 return
to normal pricing after the worldwide economic downturn in 2008. Retaining this outlier data during 
seasonal factor calculation would distort the computation of the seasonal portion of the time series
data for motor fuel, so it was estimated and removed from the data prior to seasonal adjustment.
Following that, seasonal factors were calculated based on this "prior adjusted" data. These seasonal
factors represent a clearer picture of the seasonal pattern in the data. The last step is for motor
fuel seasonal factors to be applied to the unadjusted data.

For the seasonal factors introduced for January 2024, BLS adjusted 46 series using intervention
analysis seasonal adjustment, including selected food and beverage items, motor fuels and vehicles.

Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Indexes

Seasonally adjusted data, including the U.S. city average all items index levels, are subject to
revision for up to 5 years after their original release. Every year, economists in the CPI calculate
new seasonal factors for seasonally adjusted series and apply them to the last 5 years of data.
Seasonally adjusted indexes beyond the last 5 years of data are considered to be final and not subject
to revision. For January 2024, revised seasonal factors and seasonally adjusted indexes for 2019 to
2023 were calculated and published. For series which are directly adjusted using the Census
X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment software, the seasonal factors for 2023 will be applied to data for
2024 to produce the seasonally adjusted 2024 indexes. Series which are indirectly seasonally adjusted
by summing seasonally adjusted component series have seasonal factors which are derived and are
therefore not available in advance.

Determining Seasonal Status

Each year the seasonal status of every series is reevaluated based upon certain statistical criteria.
Using these criteria, BLS economists determine whether a series should change its status from "not
seasonally adjusted" to "seasonally adjusted", or vice versa. If any of the 81 components of the U.S.
city average all items index change their seasonal adjustment status from seasonally adjusted to not
seasonally adjusted, not seasonally adjusted data will be used in the aggregation of the dependent
series for the last 5 years, but the seasonally adjusted indexes before that period will not be changed.
For 2024, 36 of the 81 components of the U.S. city average all items index are not seasonally adjusted.

		NOTE: Local area indexes are byproducts of the national CPI program.  Each local index has a smaller sample size than the national index and is, therefore, subject to substantially more sampling and other measurement error.  As a result, local area indexes show greater volatility than the national index, although their long-term trends are similar.  Therefore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics strongly urges users to consider adopting the national average CPI for use in their escalator clauses.

Footnotes
(1) The C-CPI-U is designed to be a closer approximation to a cost-of-living index in that it, in its final form, accounts for any substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices. Since the expenditure data required for the calculation of the C-CPI-U are available only with a time lag, the C-CPI-U is issued first in preliminary form using the latest available expenditure data at that time and is subject to four revisions.



		Indexes are issued as initial estimates.  Indexes are revised each quarter with the publication of January, April, July, and October data as updated expenditure estimates become available. The C-CPI-U indexes are updated quarterly until they become final.  January-March indexes are final in January of the following year; April-June indexes are final in April of the following year; July-September indexes are final in July of the following year; October-December indexes are final in October of the following year.

(1) The 'effect' of an item category is a measure of that item's contribution to the All items price change. For example, if the Food index had an effect of 0.40, and the All items index rose 1.2 percent, then the increase in food prices contributed 0.40 / 1.2, or 33.3 percent, to that All items increase. Said another way, had food prices been unchanged for that month the change in the All items index would have been 1.2 percent minus 0.40, or 0.8 percent.  Effects can be negative as well. For example, if the effect of food was a negative 0.1, and the All items index rose 0.5 percent, the All items index actually would have been 0.1 percent higher (or 0.6 percent) had food prices been unchanged. Since food prices fell while prices overall were rising, the contribution of food to the All items price change was negative (in this case, -0.1 / 0.5, or minus 20 percent).
(2) A statistic's margin of error is often expressed as its point estimate plus or minus two standard errors. For example, if a CPI category rose 0.6 percent, and its standard error was 0.15 percent, the margin of error on this item's 1-month percent change would be 0.6 percent, plus or minus 0.3 percent.
(3) If the current seasonally adjusted 1-month percent change is greater than the previous published 1-month percent change, then this column identifies the closest prior month with a 1-month percent change as (L)arge as or (L)arger than the current 1-month change.  If the current 1-month percent change is smaller than the previous published 1-month percent change, the most recent month with a change as (S)mall or (S)maller than the current month change is identified.  If the current and previous published 1-month percent changes are equal, a dash will appear.  Standard numerical comparisons are used.  For example, 0.8% is greater than 0.6%, -0.4% is less than -0.2%, and -0.2% is less than 0.0%.  Note that a (L)arger change can be a smaller decline, for example, a -0.2% change is larger than a -0.4% change, but still represents a decline in the price index.  Likewise, (S)maller changes can be increases, for example, a 0.6% change is smaller than 0.8%, but still represents an increase in the price index.  In this context, a -0.2% change is considered to be smaller than a 0.0% change.

If the current 12-month percent change is smaller than the previous published 12-month percent change, the most recent month with a change as (S)mall or (S)maller than the current month change is identified.  If the current and previous published 12-month percent changes are equal, a dash will appear.  Standard numerical comparison is used.  For example, 2.0% is greater than 0.6%, -4.4% is less than -2.0%, and -2.0% is less than 0.0%.  Note that a (L)arger change can be a smaller decline, for example, a -0.2% change is larger than a -0.4% change, but still represents a decline in the price index.  Likewise, (S)maller changes can be increases, for example, a 0.6% change is smaller than 0.8%, but still represents an increase in the price index.  In this context, a -0.2% change is considered to be smaller than a 0.0% change.
