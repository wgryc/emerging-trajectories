...A Pacific storm system pushing into the West Coast will bring locally
heavy rain near the coast, and heavy high elevation snowfall into the
Intermountain West over the next couple of days...

...Quick-hitting wave of low pressure will bring a round of accumulating
snowfall across the upper Midwest tonight, heavy snow across the Great
Lakes Thursday and into New England Thursday night and Friday morning...

...Next round of snow expected to quickly spread across the central Plains
to the Ohio Valley on Friday with showers and some thunderstorms across
the Mid-South...

Moderate to locally heavy precipitation associated with a Pacific low
pressure system is currently overspreading northern California and into 
Oregon.  The moisture will then penetrate into much of the northwestern 
U.S. and begin to interact with colder air slowly filtering across the 
northern Rockies.  This interaction will expand the coverage of snow 
eastward across much of the Intermountain West through the next couple 
of days.  The higher terrain of the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and the 
northern Rockies will receive the highest snowfall amounts of as much 
as 2 feet with isolated heavier amounts going through Thursday.  By 
Friday, a reinforcing push of polar air from Canada will bring colder 
and drier air into the northern Plains and northern Rockies. 
Meanwhile, the snow will be pushed farther south toward and into the
central Rockies near and behind the polar front.  A piece of upper-level
energy ejecting out of the Rockies will help develop a new low pressure
system over the central High Plains and quickly head east across the
central Plains Thursday night into Friday morning.  This new system will
bring the next round of snow across the central Plains to the Ohio Valley
on Friday with showers and some thunderstorms developing across the
Mid-South by Friday afternoon.

Meanwhile, a developing wave of low pressure along a front is expected to
spread a quick round of accumulating snowfall across the upper Midwest
through tonight, across the Great Lakes on Thursday, and into New England
Thursday night and Friday morning.  A few inches of snow can be expected
to accompany this system over the upper Midwest tonight.  As the system
intensifies on Thursday, 6 to 12 inches can be expected across the central
Great Lakes with locally higher amounts possible.  6 to 12 inches of snow
can also be expected across upstate New York into northern New England
downstream from Lake Ontario due to moisture and instability enhancement
as the low pressure center quickly moves across the region Thursday night
and then exits New England Friday morning. 

Temperatures along the Eastern Seaboard will be generally below normal
into Thursday morning.  Milder air over the mid-section of the country
today will spread east into much of the eastern U.S. on Thursday. 
However, an reinforcing push of arctic air from Canada will bring below
normal temperatures through the northern tier states on Friday with much
below normal temperatures spreading into the northern High Plains.  Much
of the Southwest will average near or slightly above normal through Friday.

***Multiple atmospheric river events possible for portions of
California with heavy rain and Sierra snow***

...General Overview...

Upper troughing to the east of the Rockies to start the weekend
should steadily retreat northward into Canada while an incoming
Pacific shortwave passes through an Intermountain West mean ridge
and continues eastward across the lower 48.  Meanwhile a southern
stream shortwave progressing from Mexico into the Gulf will
support one or more weak frontal waves that should track across or
just south of Florida and then offshore.  The combination of upper
troughing east of the Rockies and broad surface high pressure
originally from Canada settling over the southern tier this
weekend will bring chilly conditions, with a warmer trend next
week.  The West Coast will likely become quite unsettled going
into the weekend and especially into early next week with
increasing chances of multiple atmospheric river events for
portions of central and southern California.  Some areas of
lighter precipitation may spread across other parts of the West as
well.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Across the eastern Pacific/western U.S., guidance agrees
reasonably well for the leading system affecting the region but
some differences arise for the stronger trailing Pacific system. 
The most prominent difference involves latest GFS runs straying
slower with the upper trough and farther southwest than consensus
with the embedded upper low by Tuesday-Wednesday.  This represents
a flip in the GFS/ECMWF comparison versus some earlier runs, but
the ensemble means strongly support faster progression than the
GFS by the middle of next week and in fact the 00Z
ECMWF-initialized machine learning models suggest timing could
even be a little faster than the means.  Thus preferences lean
more toward the ECMWF and ensemble means when timing spread
develops.  Some CMC runs have been on the slow side as well but
with a questionable evolution over the northeastern
Pacific/northwestern North America.  Also worth noting, the ML
models suggest that the upper low and associated surface system
could ultimately track farther north than even the ensemble means
and most 00Z/06Z models.  The new 12Z ECMWF has in fact adjusted
that way, bringing the weakening upper/surface low to the Pacific
Northwest instead of California, while also accelerating the upper
trough. 

Elsewhere, there is decent agreement in principle for an Upper
Great Lakes/New England wave around Sunday-Monday but continued
detail differences.  The 06Z GFS deviated the most from other
guidance by early Monday with a slow/deep solution.  Behind this
system the guidance generally shows a mean frontal boundary draped
across the northern tier but with poor agreement/continuity for
specifics given sensitivity of surface waves to low-predictability
shortwave details.  A model composite looks reasonable for the
surface wave(s) crossing the Gulf of Mexico/Florida during the
weekend.

Based on the above considerations, the updated forecast
incorporated the 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS plus smaller weights of the
00Z UKMET/CMC early-mid period and then quickly transitioned to
about half 06Z GEFS/00Z ECens means with remaining ECMWF/GFS input
by day 7 next Wednesday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Guidance continues to show one or more frontal waves developing
over the Gulf by Saturday morning and then tracking across or just
south of the southern Florida Peninsula during the rest of the
weekend.  The most consequential rainfall should be mainly
confined to northern Florida on Saturday and then most likely
South Florida (but with considerable spread for northward extent)
on Sunday.  Although rainfall totals are generally expected to be
on the order of 1 to 2.5 inches, there may be potential episodes
of training convection across northern Florida on Saturday to
justify a Marginal Risk there in the Day 4 Excessive Rainfall
Outlook.  Some slower moving cells may develop across the metro
areas of Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, and this
may locally produce enough heavy rainfall on Sunday to warrant a
Marginal Risk area for Day 5 outlook.  The aforementioned spread
for Sunday's rainfall coverage tempers confidence in the details
but there is better model/ensemble agreement that the greatest
moisture anomalies will align over southern Florida, supporting
the existing Marginal Risk area.

A more substantial axis of heavier rainfall is becoming more
likely across the northern half of California going into Saturday
and extending inland across upslope areas of the northern Sierra,
with some rainfall totals potentially reaching at least two
inches.  The axis of highest PW anomalies will likely be oriented
towards the higher terrain of the coastal mountain ranges between
San Francisco and Eureka, where a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is depicted for the Day 4 period.  There are still detail
differences that require monitoring, but for now there is enough
support to maintain the existing Slight Risk and surrounding
Marginal Risk area until more specific trends become evident. 
Looking ahead to Sunday, expect another atmospheric river event to
arrive ahead of a slow moving Pacific low approaching California,
with anomalous moisture flux directed towards the coastal terrain
of central California.  While the best moisture anomalies cluster
over south-central California by the end of the Day 5 period early
Monday, model/ensemble signals for heaviest rainfall are less
defined.  This favors keeping the existing Marginal Risk area
while waiting for a more coherent QPF focus in the guidance. 
Beyond early Monday, highest rainfall totals over California
should be during the first half of the week and over the
Transverse Ranges where several inches of rainfall will be
possible, so this will event continue to be monitored closely. 
Heavy snow is also likely for the Sierra and northern California
mountains during this time period.  The two separate systems
affecting California should spread some moisture with lighter
precipitation totals across portions of the Intermountain West and
Rockies.

The upper/eastern Great Lakes into New England may see some areas
of lake effect/terrain enhanced snowfall during the weekend in
association with upper troughing and a surface system crossing the
region around Sunday-Sunday night.  Then a front and embedded
waves may produce some areas of light rain/snow over the Great
Lakes/Northeast and vicinity by Tuesday or Wednesday, but with low
confidence in specifics at this time.  

The surface high settling over the southern tier states this
weekend behind a cold front will likely promote temperatures
running about 5-15 degrees below mid-February averages from Texas
to the Ohio Valley on Saturday with some below normal readings
persisting over parts of the southern tier (especially near the
Gulf Coast/Florida) into Sunday or Monday.  The Plains and Midwest
will trend warmer from Sunday onward as mean flow aloft become
more westerly, with some locations over the central Plains/Midwest
seeing the best potential for highs reaching 20 degrees or more
above normal by next Tuesday-Wednesday.  Remaining areas east of
the Rockies should trend above average as well.  Clouds and
precipitation will favor above normal lows and near to slightly
below normal highs across the West.

Model guidance has been consistent with a relatively strong cold
front reaching the northwestern Islands on Thursday morning, and
then clearing the Big Island by Friday afternoon, bringing
slightly cooler temperatures and lower humidity.  High pressure
gradually builds in from the west going into the weekend based on
the ensemble means, with the surface high centered just north of
the main Islands by next Monday before moving to a position
northeast of the state by Tuesday based on the ensemble means.  A
col may develop within the main subtropical ridge axis by next
Wednesday with a weak frontal boundary approaching the
northwestern Islands.

The passage of the cold front will bring a stronger wind surge out
of the north late Thursday into Friday as the cold front clears
the state, followed by northeasterly flow over the weekend that
gradually veers to the east.  There will likely be some increase
in shower coverage across the Islands for the end of the week as
the front passes, but otherwise no organized areas of heavy
rainfall are anticipated.

...A MARGINAL RISK OF EXCESSIVE RAINFALL EXISTS FOR PORTIONS OF 
SOUTHWEST OREGON & NORTHWEST CALIFORNIA...

...16Z Update...

Only minor adjustments were made to the southern edge of the 
previous MRGL risk area across northwest CA based on the latest 
QPF trends within the HREF/NBM ensemble suite. Precip amounts of 
around 2-3" with locally as high as 4" will be possible across the 
Klamath Range in southwest OR and northwestern CA through this 
afternoon. Interior areas will see a waning threat of rainfall 
with a shift to wintry precip due to progression of the shortwave 
trough with attendant height falls and surface cold front 
protruding inland. Threat remains minor in general with best 
potential within the terrain just inland of the immediate coast. 

Kleebauer


...Previous Discussion...

Portions of coastal OR and northwest CA...
The southern lobe of an elongated mid to upper-level trough/closed 
low, now approaching 140W, should continue on an eastward 
trajectory and be near the Oregon/California border later this 
afternoon or early evening.  While uncertainty remains in the 
evolution of this feature and its interaction with a developing 
closed low off of the Washington coast, the 00Z models continued 
to be in somewhat better agreement with the overall pattern 
evolution (a trend that began with the 12Z model cycle on Monday).

Warm advection isentropic lift driven precipitation should be 
ongoing at the start of the period across northwest California 
that gradually expands in coverage to southwestern Oregon but the 
highest intensity rainfall should arrive with an occluded/cold 
front with the 14/00Z HREF indicating the probability of exceeding 
0.5 in/hr rainfall at 10 to 30 percent near the coastal 
Oregon/California border by late morning and peaking 30 to 50 
percent between Cape Mendocino and the Santa Lucia Range around 
21Z. However, the progressive nature of the front and very weak 
instability (< 250 J/kg) should limit the duration/magnitude of 
these higher rates with localized 2-4 inch totals over the 24 hour 
period ending 12Z Thursday. The highest rainfall should focus 
along south to southwesterly facing slopes given a similar 
orientation of the low level wind. Across the northern foothills 
of the Sierra Nevada, there will be a narrow region below snow 
levels of 5,000 to 6,000 feet where locally heavy rain of 2-3 
inches and brief rainfall rates over 0.5 in/hr will be possible. 
However, this inland region appears too low end for a Marginal at 
this time.

Day 2
Valid 12Z Thu Feb 15 2024 - 12Z Fri Feb 16 2024 

The probability of rainfall exceeding flash flood guidance is less 
than 5 percent.

...21Z Update...

The previous forecast reasoning still holds, and a blank Day 2 ERO 
was maintained with the afternoon forecast cycle. With a lack of 
surface forcing and instability, it will be hard to get rain rates 
high enough to cause flash flooding in South Texas, a region that 
has been relatively dry and has high flash flood guidance. Most 
hi-res guidance shows 24 hour precipitation totals reaching 2-3 
inches at most with rainfall rates likely remaining below an inch 
per hour. The HRRR is more aggressive with QPF due to stronger 
convergence across South Texas Bush Country, but still just barely 
reaches totals near floash flood guidance. 

Kleebauer/Dolan

...Previous Discussion...

Lower Rio Grande Valley of Southern TX...
Low level moisture will return ahead of a shortwave trough in the 
southern stream...with precipitable water vales increasing into 
the 1.5 to 2.0 inch range across southern Texas by 12Z on Friday. 
The problem continues to be the lack of a low level boundary. 
Guidance is still able to generate some convection across parts of 
the Lower Rio Grande Valley with maximum QPF generally in the 1.5 
to 2.5 inch range. Relatively dry antecedant conditions combined 
with a lack of better instability should limit any flooding 
potential. The area will continue to be monitored for changes with 
future forecast cycles.

Day 3
Valid 12Z Fri Feb 16 2024 - 12Z Sat Feb 17 2024 

The probability of rainfall exceeding flash flood guidance is less 
than 5 percent.

...21Z Update...

After coordination with the Brownsville and Corpus Christi WFOs, 
the Marginal Risk area along the Lower Texas Coast was removed 
from the Day 3 ERO. There is a large amount of spread in QPF 
totals amongst models, but most ensemble means and deterministic 
runs continue to show totals only near 1-2 inches with locally 
higher amounts possible. The coastal plains of Texas would be able 
to handle this amount of rainfall with only nuisance flooding in 
urban and poor drainage areas. The forecast could change depending 
on the placement of the developing surface low. If the low remains 
removed from the coast over the western Gulf with accompanying 
instability gradient, then the highest precipitation totals will 
likely focus over the Gulf. However, if the low develops right 
along the Lower Texas Coast, then the higher amounts could shift 
over the coastal plain and potentially cause isolated flooding 
concerns, especially within the urban centers like Corpus up to 
Victoria. This area will continue to be monitored as the forecast 
updates/changes over the next couple days.

Kleebauer/Dolan

...Previous Discussion...

Continued amplification of the wave at mid-levels over northern 
Mexico during the period will push a cold front into the southern 
part of Texas and support showery conditions.  The expectation is 
that a surface low will develop over portions of the western Gulf 
of Mexico and eventually focus the heavy rainfall away from land.  
Until that happens...deep moisture will be in place with 
precipitable water values in excess of 1.6 inches / some 2 to 3 
standardized anomalies above climatology for this time of the year 
/ with generally modest low level moisture transport into the 
region.  Given that deterministic QPF is on the order of an inch 
or two...and the antecedent have been dry over an area of 
primarily agricultural land usage...it would appear that much of 
the area could handle the rain with limited exceptions in regions 
of poor drainage or in urban areas.

Guidance continues to show one or more frontal waves developing
over the Gulf by Saturday morning and then tracking across or just
south of the southern Florida Peninsula during the rest of the
weekend.  The most consequential rainfall should be mainly
confined to northern Florida on Saturday and then most likely
South Florida (but with considerable spread for northward extent)
on Sunday.  Although rainfall totals are generally expected to be
on the order of 1 to 2.5 inches, there may be potential episodes
of training convection across northern Florida on Saturday to
justify a Marginal Risk there in the Day 4 Excessive Rainfall
Outlook.  Some slower moving cells may develop across the metro
areas of Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, and this
may locally produce enough heavy rainfall on Sunday to warrant a
Marginal Risk area for Day 5 outlook.  The aforementioned spread
for Sunday's rainfall coverage tempers confidence in the details
but there is better model/ensemble agreement that the greatest
moisture anomalies will align over southern Florida, supporting
the existing Marginal Risk area.

A more substantial axis of heavier rainfall is becoming more
likely across the northern half of California going into Saturday
and extending inland across upslope areas of the northern Sierra,
with some rainfall totals potentially reaching at least two
inches.  The axis of highest PW anomalies will likely be oriented
towards the higher terrain of the coastal mountain ranges between
San Francisco and Eureka, where a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is depicted for the Day 4 period.  There are still detail
differences that require monitoring, but for now there is enough
support to maintain the existing Slight Risk and surrounding
Marginal Risk area until more specific trends become evident. 
Looking ahead to Sunday, expect another atmospheric river event to
arrive ahead of a slow moving Pacific low approaching California,
with anomalous moisture flux directed towards the coastal terrain
of central California.  While the best moisture anomalies cluster
over south-central California by the end of the Day 5 period early
Monday, model/ensemble signals for heaviest rainfall are less
defined.  This favors keeping the existing Marginal Risk area
while waiting for a more coherent QPF focus in the guidance. 
Beyond early Monday, highest rainfall totals over California
should be during the first half of the week and over the
Transverse Ranges where several inches of rainfall will be
possible, so this will event continue to be monitored closely. 
Heavy snow is also likely for the Sierra and northern California
mountains during this time period.  The two separate systems
affecting California should spread some moisture with lighter
precipitation totals across portions of the Intermountain West and
Rockies.

The upper/eastern Great Lakes into New England may see some areas
of lake effect/terrain enhanced snowfall during the weekend in
association with upper troughing and a surface system crossing the
region around Sunday-Sunday night.  Then a front and embedded
waves may produce some areas of light rain/snow over the Great
Lakes/Northeast and vicinity by Tuesday or Wednesday, but with low
confidence in specifics at this time.  

The surface high settling over the southern tier states this
weekend behind a cold front will likely promote temperatures
running about 5-15 degrees below mid-February averages from Texas
to the Ohio Valley on Saturday with some below normal readings
persisting over parts of the southern tier (especially near the
Gulf Coast/Florida) into Sunday or Monday.  The Plains and Midwest
will trend warmer from Sunday onward as mean flow aloft become
more westerly, with some locations over the central Plains/Midwest
seeing the best potential for highs reaching 20 degrees or more
above normal by next Tuesday-Wednesday.  Remaining areas east of
the Rockies should trend above average as well.  Clouds and
precipitation will favor above normal lows and near to slightly
below normal highs across the West.

...Northwest and Intermountain West...
Days 1-2...

A strong shortwave trough moving into NorCal/OR will move into the
coast as a retrograding trough pushes west off the coast of WA.
The merging of these 2 areas of energy will result in a
developing, albeit short-lived, low over WA State through Friday
morning. The low will quickly shear apart and dissipate by Friday
evening. The interaction of these shortwaves and the resulting
upper low will provide plenty of lift over the well-entrenched
Arctic air mass over all of the Intermountain West. Further,
strong onshore flow in the lower levels will advect plentiful
Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest as well. The result
will be a long-duration snowfall event, largely highlighting the
Cascades of OR and southern WA, the Boise/Sawtooth of ID,
Bitterroots of MT, the Yellowstone and Tetons, and the Wind River
Ranges of WY. Expect multiple feet of snow over these 2 days in
each of these areas, with maximum accumulations approaching 4 feet
into the OR Cascades which will get the brunt of the Pacific
moisture, and over 3 feet into the Tetons and Wind River Ranges of
WY. Forecast WSSI is for major impacts into these mountain ranges
with Moderate impacts across central ID. Minor impacts are likely
across much of the area from the Cascades east through the High
Plains of south-central MT.


...Great Lakes to the Interior Northeast...
Days 1-2...

Surface low pressure over the central Plains will move ENE tonight
into early Thu toward southern Lower Michigan. In the mid-levels,
a northern and southern stream shortwave will merge/interact over
southern Ontario as the upper jet increases over the Southeast.
Combination of upper divergence and incoming height falls/PVA as
the combined shortwave tries to close off over northern New
England will promote an expanding area of snowfall from the Great
Lakes eastward, initially tied to a modest/strong area of FGEN
over northern Lower Michigan where WPC probabilities for at least
4 inches of snow are greater than 50%. Snow could be heavy in
bands with HREF probs of >1"/hr up to 60-80% around Alpena Thu
morning (and 10-30% probs for >2"/hr). Lower probabilities stretch
back to the west across WI tied to the incoming northern stream
cold front. By D2 (late Thu into Friday), low pressure will slip
steadily eastward through NY into New England before translating
to the Gulf of Maine early Fri. Again, WAA/FGEN into northern NY
and New England will support modest snows with embedded heavier
bands though the quick movement will limit amounts somewhat.
Still, WPC probabilities for at least 4 inches are high (>70%)
over much of the Tug Hill/Adirondack region and into the
Green/White Mountains in VT/NH.


...Central/Northern Rockies & Central/Northern Great Plains...
Days 1-2...

A fast-moving 500mb vorticity maximum moving through the Great
Basin early Thursday will help guide mid/lower-level moisture to
the Rockies and onto the Plains tomorrow afternoon/evening. Though
the pattern is decidedly blocky over northwestern Canada, it is
quite zonal in the mid-latitudes which will help zip this system
along. However, with Canadian high pressure settling into northern
MT, easterly to southeasterly flow in the low levels will help
draw in some Gulf moisture to the central Plains on the cold side
of a wobbly surface boundary east of the terrain. Mountain snows
over parts of eastern WY into CO will continue through D1 into
early D2 along the surface front, at the same time a broad area of
snow expands eastward in conjunction with height falls as a
mid-level trough moves in from the north. Models have mostly
converged toward an axis from around the Black Hills ESE across
southern SD though the ECMWF-led guidance is still generally
lighter than the GFS-led guidance, tied to a swath of favorable
FGEN at the entrance region of the upper jet. WPC probabilities
for at least 4 inches of snow are high (>70%) over parts of
northeastern WY into the Black Hills and into south central SD (in
addition to the northern CO Rockies). Though probabilities for >8"
are low (~10%), 12Z HREF probs of >1"/hr around 20-40% suggest
there could be some embedded higher amounts not fully realized in
the ensemble guidance. The system will continue through the Mid-MS
Valley/Mid-South with a swath of light snow along I-70 into the
Ohio Valley, but probabilities for at least 4" are currently lower
than 10%.


...Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...
Day 3...

The system mentioned above will continue eastward on D3, spreading
light snow from the OH/TN Valley eastward Fri evening into the
central Appalachians beneath a ballooning upper jet (wide expanse
of >150kts from the Mid-South to Bermuda with a jet max
approaching 200kts over VA). Low pressure is expected to move
across eastern TN and continue quickly eastward as height falls
dig into the Great Lakes/Midwest/central Appalachians. QPF will
move through the region into the Mid-Atlantic overnight, which
would help with accumulations assuming the boundary layer can cool
off enough. There will be a transition to cold rain over parts of
southern VA closer to the track of the low, where the NBM ptype
probs maximize uncertainty. However, slight tick colder in some
guidance suggests accumulating snow across much of the region,
focused mostly on eastern WV with help from upslope enhancement.
There, WPC probabilities for at least 4 inches of snow are
moderate (40-60%), with lower probabilities into the Laurel
Highlands and eastward across southern PA. Measurable snow is
likely all the way to the coast/beaches and perhaps as far south
as around the Richmond area (depending on thermals).

***Multiple atmospheric river events possible for portions of
California with heavy rain and Sierra snow***

...General Overview...

Upper troughing to the east of the Rockies to start the weekend
should steadily retreat northward into Canada while an incoming
Pacific shortwave passes through an Intermountain West mean ridge
and continues eastward across the lower 48.  Meanwhile a southern
stream shortwave progressing from Mexico into the Gulf will
support one or more weak frontal waves that should track across or
just south of Florida and then offshore.  The combination of upper
troughing east of the Rockies and broad surface high pressure
originally from Canada settling over the southern tier this
weekend will bring chilly conditions, with a warmer trend next
week.  The West Coast will likely become quite unsettled going
into the weekend and especially into early next week with
increasing chances of multiple atmospheric river events for
portions of central and southern California.  Some areas of
lighter precipitation may spread across other parts of the West as
well.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Across the eastern Pacific/western U.S., guidance agrees
reasonably well for the leading system affecting the region but
some differences arise for the stronger trailing Pacific system. 
The most prominent difference involves latest GFS runs straying
slower with the upper trough and farther southwest than consensus
with the embedded upper low by Tuesday-Wednesday.  This represents
a flip in the GFS/ECMWF comparison versus some earlier runs, but
the ensemble means strongly support faster progression than the
GFS by the middle of next week and in fact the 00Z
ECMWF-initialized machine learning models suggest timing could
even be a little faster than the means.  Thus preferences lean
more toward the ECMWF and ensemble means when timing spread
develops.  Some CMC runs have been on the slow side as well but
with a questionable evolution over the northeastern
Pacific/northwestern North America.  Also worth noting, the ML
models suggest that the upper low and associated surface system
could ultimately track farther north than even the ensemble means
and most 00Z/06Z models.  The new 12Z ECMWF has in fact adjusted
that way, bringing the weakening upper/surface low to the Pacific
Northwest instead of California, while also accelerating the upper
trough. 

Elsewhere, there is decent agreement in principle for an Upper
Great Lakes/New England wave around Sunday-Monday but continued
detail differences.  The 06Z GFS deviated the most from other
guidance by early Monday with a slow/deep solution.  Behind this
system the guidance generally shows a mean frontal boundary draped
across the northern tier but with poor agreement/continuity for
specifics given sensitivity of surface waves to low-predictability
shortwave details.  A model composite looks reasonable for the
surface wave(s) crossing the Gulf of Mexico/Florida during the
weekend.

Based on the above considerations, the updated forecast
incorporated the 00Z ECMWF/00Z-06Z GFS plus smaller weights of the
00Z UKMET/CMC early-mid period and then quickly transitioned to
about half 06Z GEFS/00Z ECens means with remaining ECMWF/GFS input
by day 7 next Wednesday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Guidance continues to show one or more frontal waves developing
over the Gulf by Saturday morning and then tracking across or just
south of the southern Florida Peninsula during the rest of the
weekend.  The most consequential rainfall should be mainly
confined to northern Florida on Saturday and then most likely
South Florida (but with considerable spread for northward extent)
on Sunday.  Although rainfall totals are generally expected to be
on the order of 1 to 2.5 inches, there may be potential episodes
of training convection across northern Florida on Saturday to
justify a Marginal Risk there in the Day 4 Excessive Rainfall
Outlook.  Some slower moving cells may develop across the metro
areas of Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, and this
may locally produce enough heavy rainfall on Sunday to warrant a
Marginal Risk area for Day 5 outlook.  The aforementioned spread
for Sunday's rainfall coverage tempers confidence in the details
but there is better model/ensemble agreement that the greatest
moisture anomalies will align over southern Florida, supporting
the existing Marginal Risk area.

A more substantial axis of heavier rainfall is becoming more
likely across the northern half of California going into Saturday
and extending inland across upslope areas of the northern Sierra,
with some rainfall totals potentially reaching at least two
inches.  The axis of highest PW anomalies will likely be oriented
towards the higher terrain of the coastal mountain ranges between
San Francisco and Eureka, where a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is depicted for the Day 4 period.  There are still detail
differences that require monitoring, but for now there is enough
support to maintain the existing Slight Risk and surrounding
Marginal Risk area until more specific trends become evident. 
Looking ahead to Sunday, expect another atmospheric river event to
arrive ahead of a slow moving Pacific low approaching California,
with anomalous moisture flux directed towards the coastal terrain
of central California.  While the best moisture anomalies cluster
over south-central California by the end of the Day 5 period early
Monday, model/ensemble signals for heaviest rainfall are less
defined.  This favors keeping the existing Marginal Risk area
while waiting for a more coherent QPF focus in the guidance. 
Beyond early Monday, highest rainfall totals over California
should be during the first half of the week and over the
Transverse Ranges where several inches of rainfall will be
possible, so this will event continue to be monitored closely. 
Heavy snow is also likely for the Sierra and northern California
mountains during this time period.  The two separate systems
affecting California should spread some moisture with lighter
precipitation totals across portions of the Intermountain West and
Rockies.

The upper/eastern Great Lakes into New England may see some areas
of lake effect/terrain enhanced snowfall during the weekend in
association with upper troughing and a surface system crossing the
region around Sunday-Sunday night.  Then a front and embedded
waves may produce some areas of light rain/snow over the Great
Lakes/Northeast and vicinity by Tuesday or Wednesday, but with low
confidence in specifics at this time.  

The surface high settling over the southern tier states this
weekend behind a cold front will likely promote temperatures
running about 5-15 degrees below mid-February averages from Texas
to the Ohio Valley on Saturday with some below normal readings
persisting over parts of the southern tier (especially near the
Gulf Coast/Florida) into Sunday or Monday.  The Plains and Midwest
will trend warmer from Sunday onward as mean flow aloft become
more westerly, with some locations over the central Plains/Midwest
seeing the best potential for highs reaching 20 degrees or more
above normal by next Tuesday-Wednesday.  Remaining areas east of
the Rockies should trend above average as well.  Clouds and
precipitation will favor above normal lows and near to slightly
below normal highs across the West.
