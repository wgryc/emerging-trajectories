How to Read the Plots:
Below is an example of the monthly climate plot. The observed high and low temperatures are indicated by the tops and bottoms of the vertical blue bars, respectively. The normal temperature ranges are indicated by the green band. Record highs are shown on the top of the light pink band, and record lows are indicated along the bottom of the light blue band.

						Please note that Columbia Metro and Augusta Bush Field will have both the normals and record data included on the plots. Jim Hamilton - L.B. Owens Airport, Orangeburg, and Augusta Daniel Field will only have the normals.




						Next we have an example of the year to date climate plot. As with the monthly plot, observed temperatures are shown by the dark blue areas, normals with the light green areas, record highs in the light red areas, and record lows in the light blue areas. The bottom portion of the graph indicates the precipitation for the year to date. The yellow line (and green area below it) represents the normal year to date total at the given time frame. Periods that have year to date totals above the climatological normals are shown by dark green areas above the yellow line. Periods that are below normal are shown with the brown areas below the yellow line.

						Please note that Columbia Metro and Augusta Bush Field will have both the normals and record data included on the plots. Jim Hamilton - L.B. Owens Airport, Orangeburg, and Augusta Daniel Field will only have the normals.
