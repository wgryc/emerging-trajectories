    global economy. These contribute to the ECB Governing Council’s assessment of economic developments and risks to

March 2024At a glance





Inflation outlook



Inflation should decline over the next few years, but more slowly than in 2023. Owing to fading cost pressures and the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy, headline inflation should fall from 5.4% in 2023 to 2.3% in 2024 and then to 2.0% in 2025, reaching 1.9% in 2026.

Gross domestic product outlook



Economic growth will remain weak in the short term, owing to tight financing conditions and subdued confidence. As inflation falls, household income recovers and foreign demand strengthens, real GDP should increase by 0.6% in 2024, by 1.5% in 2025 and by 1.6% in 2026.
