Based on the content provided from various sources, here is a succinct list of critical points supporting the forecast, followed by a logical rationale and the forecast for oil prices by the end of 2024.


**Critical Points:**

F1: Global oil demand growth slowed in 4Q23, with growth projected to ease from 2.3 mb/d in 2023 to 1.2 mb/d in 2024 due to macroeconomic headwinds and efficiency improvements [8].

F2: World oil supply is forecast to rise by 1.5 mb/d to a record 103.5 mb/d in 2024, primarily driven by non-OPEC+ countries like the US, Brazil, Guyana, and Canada [8].

F3: Goldman Sachs cut its 2024 oil price forecast by 12% to an average of $81 per barrel for Brent, citing abundant US production [4].

F4: The IEA expects the Brent crude oil price to average $82/b in 2024 and $79/b in 2025, with global supply and demand relatively balanced [9].

F5: Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly affecting the Red Sea trade route, could introduce volatility to oil markets [8].

F6: Sarah Kiernan from Goldman Sachs mentioned a possible continuation of ample oil supply in 2024, with the growth in oil supply outpacing demand and causing softer oil prices [13].

F7: Non-OPEC production growth is expected to be robust in 2024, with a special note on expected strong growth from countries outside of the US [14].

F8: Political and geopolitical events, such as tensions in the Middle East, might cause sharp but transitory prices increases [16].

**Logic and Rationale:**

The projections for slower demand growth coupled with an increase in supply, especially from non-OPEC+ countries, lay the foundation for a relatively bearish outlook on oil prices. The forecast by Goldman Sachs, which lowers the Brent crude oil price expectation for 2024, aligns with this narrative of ample supply [4]. However, geopolitical risks could introduce substantial volatility into the market, especially considering sensitive regions like the Middle East that play a crucial role in global oil trade [8]. Moreover, the IEA projections support a scenario of balance between supply and demand over the next two years, potentially stabilizing prices but at levels slightly lower than those seen in recent years [9]. Considering these factors, the risk to oil prices appears to be skewed more towards the downside, with room for temporary spikes in response to geopolitical tensions.

**Forecast:**

The price of oil by the end of the 2024 calendar year will be $80 USD per barrel.

Basing this forecast on input from the IEA and Goldman Sachs provides a balanced view between supply-demand dynamics and external market factors like geopolitical risks. The figure aligns with the projected average by the IEA for 2024 and accounts for potential volatility tied to global events [4] [9].
