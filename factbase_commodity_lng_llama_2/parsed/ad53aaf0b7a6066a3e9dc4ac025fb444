Biden’s LNG Export Ban is Based on Politics, Not Science

President Biden’s LNG export ban is an election-year decision to appease radical environmental activists who are intent on shutting down American energy. This decision jeopardizes our economy and our energy security. That’s why we're leading on H.R. 7176, the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act of 2024, to reverse President Biden’s export ban and unleash American LNG to lower energy costs, advance U.S. energy security as well as the security of our allies, and reduce emissions.

“Currently accounting for 22 percent of global primary energy consumption, natural gas will remain crucial to the world’s energy mix through 2050, even as alternative energy use grows, according to the latest International Energy Agency projections.”

“Unfortunately for the world, Russia produces much of this vital resource, as Europe discovered to its dismay when President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine—with an army that had been funded by earnings from Russian gas exports. Fortunately for the world, the United States has emerged as the top exporter of the supercooled form known as liquefied natural gas, or LNG. In fact, after the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration launched a largely successful effort to help allies substitute American LNG, delivered via ships, for pipelined Russian gas."

However, that same Biden administration ordered a de facto halt to the approval of new facilities for exporting the resource to countries with which the United States does not have free-trade agreements—a category that includes all of Europe. It’s an election-year sop to climate activists that will do much more to unsettle vital U.S. alliances than to save the planet.” 

“The main short-run damage the administration’s obviously political decision does is to the United States’ reputation for rational, fact-based policymaking, and for wise consideration of climate control in the context of geopolitics. You cannot change demand for energy by destroying supply: If the United States did indeed curtail LNG exports, it would just drive customers into the arms of competitors such as Australia, Qatar, Algeria and, yes, Russia."

“The closer one looks, the more harm this raw political payoff to the climate left will do to U.S. national security and economic interests.” 

“The Administration is deliberately creating uncertainty about permit approvals and extensions to chill investment and discourage foreign governments from signing long-term contracts. Why risk investing in or signing a purchase agreement with a Gulf Coast project that may later be killed? Smarter to link up with the Qataris."

“While the Administration downplays the national-security risks of its self-embargo, U.S. allies worry it will make them more vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions. About 20% of the global LNG supply travels through the Strait of Hormuz. LNG cargoes to Europe are now being diverted from the Red Sea because of Houthi missile attacks. 

“Russian and Iranian proxies could cause LNG prices to spike by attacking one or two large Qatar export facilities. Some countries in Asia might then burn more coal as they did in 2022 when LNG prices shot up. But Europeans are planning to retire coal and nuclear plants in the coming years on the expectation that they will have ample LNG from the U.S. 

“As for America’s economic interests, a single LNG export project will produce about $600 billion in revenue over its lifespan and create thousands of jobs, including in steel manufacturing and fracking—no government subsidies required.”

“A prominent Gen Z climate activist, who has amassed nearly 700,000 followers on TikTok, said he met with White House officials ahead of President Biden's decision to pause major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.” 

“Then, after he started posting the videos, Haraus said he met with White House climate advisers alongside environmental activists from the Gulf Coast also opposed to the projects. And on Jan. 26, the White House and Department of Energy (DOE) announced it had paused permitting for all pending LNG export terminals over climate impacts, appearing to cede to the activists' demands.” 

“‘I was with activists from the Gulf Coast who have been fighting this for years,’” Haraus told Fox News Digital when asked about the White House meetings. "The policy demonstrates that they were somewhat receptive." 

“Following the joint White House and DOE announcement last month announcing the LNG export terminal permitting moratorium, Republicans, Democrats and energy industry groups have blasted the Biden administration for handing Russia a victory. 

“In a letter to Biden, more than 150 House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., argued that pausing LNG export growth threatens to cause increased U.S. energy prices, leads to higher global greenhouse gas emissions and harms the U.S. economy. 

“The letter pointed to studies showing that LNG exports could add as much as $73 billion to the U.S. economy by 2040, create upwards of 453,000 American jobs and increase U.S. purchasing power by $30 billion.”
