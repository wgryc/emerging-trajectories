The ACCC publishes the LNG netback price series to improve transparency of gas prices in the east coast gas market. 

An LNG netback price is a measure of an export parity price that a gas supplier can expect to receive for exporting its gas. It is calculated by taking the price that could be received for LNG and subtracting or ‘netting back’ the costs incurred by the supplier to convert the gas to LNG and ship it to the destination port.

LNG netback prices based on Asian LNG spot prices and oil-linked LNG contract prices currently play an important role in influencing gas prices in the east coast gas market.

An LNG netback price is not the sole factor that influences domestic prices in the east coast gas market. Individual prices paid by gas users can also reflect other factors that may be relevant to their circumstances, including the terms and conditions of their gas supply and any applicable transportation or retailer charges.

Historical and forward medium-term LNG netback prices will be updated on this page once a month, and forward short-term LNG netback prices will be updated twice a month.

The prices shown are for information only and do not represent the ACCC:
