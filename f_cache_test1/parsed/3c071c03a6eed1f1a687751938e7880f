First Quarter 2024 Survey of Professional Forecasters
09 Feb ’24


 






Forecasters Predict Higher Output Growth and Brighter Labor Market in 2024
The near-term  outlook for the U.S. economy looks better now than it did three months ago,  according to 34 forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  The forecasters predict the economy will expand  at an annual rate of 2.1 percent this quarter, up from the prediction of 0.8  percent in the last survey. On an annual-average over annual-average basis, the  forecasters expect real GDP to increase 2.4 percent in 2024, up 0.7 percentage  point from the estimate in the previous survey.
A  downward revision to the path for the unemployment rate accompanies the outlook  for growth. The forecasters predict the unemployment rate will increase from 3.8  percent this quarter to 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the  previous survey, the unemployment rate was forecast to rise from 4.0 percent to  4.2 percent over the same period. On an annual-average basis, the forecasters  expect the unemployment rate to average 3.9 percent in 2024, marking a downward  revision from the previous estimate of 4.1 percent.
On  the employment front, the forecasters see job gains in the current quarter at a  rate of 235,800 per month. The employment projections for the current quarter and  the following three quarters show upward revisions from those of the previous  survey. The projections for the annual-average level of nonfarm payroll  employment suggest job gains at a monthly rate of 190,000 in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 120,000. (These annual-average projections  are computed as the year-to-year change in the annual-average level of nonfarm  payroll employment, converted to a monthly rate.)

The  charts below provide some insight into the degree of uncertainty the  forecasters have about their projections for the rate of growth in the  annual-average level of real GDP. Each chart presents the forecasters’ previous  and current estimates of the probability that growth will fall into each of 11  ranges. Notably for 2024, the forecasters  are substantially increasing their probability estimates from the previous  survey for real GDP growth in the range of 1.5 percent to 3.9 percent.

The  forecasters’ density projections for unemployment, shown below, shed light on  uncertainty about the labor market over the next four years. Each chart  presents the forecasters’ current and previous estimates of the probability  that unemployment will fall into each of 10 ranges. For 2024, the forecasters are raising their  probability estimates from the previous survey for an unemployment rate in the  range of 3.0 percent to 3.9 percent.

Forecasters Project Lower Near-Term Headline Inflation
The forecasters expect  current-quarter headline CPI inflation will average 2.5 percent at an annual  rate, down from their prediction of 2.8 percent in the previous survey.  Headline PCE inflation over the current quarter will also be lower at an annual  rate of 1.9 percent, down from the previous estimate of 2.5 percent. The  predictions for current-quarter core CPI and core PCE inflation, on the other  hand, are mixed. The forecasters predict lower core PCE inflation but higher  core CPI inflation over the current quarter, compared with their predictions in  the last survey.
Projections for both headline  and core PCE inflation in 2024 will be lower at an annual rate of 2.1 percent,  down from the previous predictions of 2.4 percent.
Over the next 10 years, 2024 to 2033, the  forecasters predict headline CPI inflation will be an annual-average rate of 2.24  percent. The corresponding estimate for 10-year annual-average PCE inflation is  2.00 percent. These 10-year projections are 0.16 percentage point and 0.22  percentage point lower than those of the previous survey, which covered the  10-year horizon from 2023 to 2032.

The  charts below show the median projections (the red line) and the associated  interquartile ranges (gray areas around the red line) for 10-year annual-average  CPI and PCE inflation. The charts provide perspective on the lower 10-year  inflation expectations in the current survey. 

Projections for the 10-Year Annual-Average Rate of CPI Inflation (chart)
Projections for the 10-Year Annual-Average Rate of PCE Inflation (chart)

The figures  below show the probabilities that the forecasters are assigning to each of 10 possible  ranges for fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter core PCE inflation in 2024 and  2025. For 2024, the forecasters have significantly  raised their estimates for the probability that core PCE inflation will be in  the range of 1.5 percent to 2.4 percent, compared with their predictions in the  last survey.

Lower Risk of a Contraction in Real GDP in 2024
The forecasters see the risk  of a downturn in real GDP this quarter at 17.3 percent, down sharply from the previous  estimate of 40.9 percent. Moreover, they have also lowered their  probability estimates for negative growth for the following three quarters,  compared with their previous estimates. The forecasters now predict a (nearly) one-in-four chance of a  contraction in real GDP in each of the remaining three quarters in 2024.

Forecasters State Their Views on House Price Growth over the Next Two Years
In a special question in this survey,  panelists were asked to provide their forecasts for fourth-quarter over  fourth-quarter growth in house prices, as measured by several alternative indices.  The panelists were allowed to choose their measure from a list of indices or to  write in their own index. For each index of their choosing, the panelists provided  forecasts for growth in 2024 and 2025. 
Seventeen panelists answered the special  question. Some panelists provided projections for more than one index. The  table below provides a summary of the forecasters’ responses. The number of  responses (N) is low for each index. The median estimates for the six house  price indices listed in the table below range from 1.0 percent to 3.1 percent  in 2024 and from  -1.1 percent to 2.5  percent in 2025.

Improved Long-Term Productivity Growth and Higher Returns on Fixed-Income Securities 
In  our first-quarter surveys, the forecasters provide their 10-year annual-average  projections for an expanded set of variables, including growth in output and  productivity, as well as returns on financial assets. 
As  the table below shows, the forecasters expect real GDP to grow at an  annual-average rate of 2.00 percent over the next 10 years, unchanged from their  projection in the first-quarter survey of 2023. Ten-year annual-average productivity growth is now expected to be  1.50 percent, up from 1.30 percent previously. 
Mixed returns on financial assets over the  next 10 years accompany the current long-term outlook for real GDP and  productivity. The forecasters predict the S&P 500 returning an  annual-average 7.00 percent over the next 10 years, down from the previous  estimate of 7.50 percent in the first-quarter survey of 2023. The forecasters  see the rate on 10-year Treasuries averaging 3.60 percent over the next 10  years, up from 3.35 percent in last year’s first-quarter survey. Three-month  Treasury bills will return an annual-average 2.78 percent over the next 10  years, up from 2.65 percent previously.
