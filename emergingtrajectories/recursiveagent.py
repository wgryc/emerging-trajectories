This is influenced by Yann LeCun's world modeling approach discussion: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7165738293223931904/ 

We are aiming to eventually build some sort of a fact base system. Until then, however, we will be passing information directly through to the agent here.

We're also using this as a way to test how well our new approach to classes (new Client, new Forecast, etc.) will work, so we can plug and play different types of agents here.

Note that this approach will *not* test new knowledge bases *yet*.
