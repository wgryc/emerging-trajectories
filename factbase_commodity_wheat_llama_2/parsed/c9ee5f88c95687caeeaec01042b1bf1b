The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) is prepared and released by the World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB). The report is released monthly, and provides annual forecasts for supply and use of U.S. and world wheat, rice, coarse grains, oilseeds, and cotton. The report also covers U.S. supply and use of sugar, meat, poultry eggs and milk, as well as Mexico’s supply and use of sugar. The WAOB chairs the Interagency Commodity Estimates Committees (ICECs), which include analysts from key USDA agencies who compile and interpret information from USDA and other domestic and foreign sources to produce the report. For more information about the WASDE process and data, visit the WASDE FAQs page.

Note: The Secretary of Agriculture briefings on the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report and the Crop Production report can be viewed live each month starting 12:05pm ET, following the release of the WASDE report, on NASS’s YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/usdanass(link is external).
