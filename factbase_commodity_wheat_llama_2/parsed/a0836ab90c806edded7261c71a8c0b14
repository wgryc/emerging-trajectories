WheatPrice - Chart - Historical Data - News

Wheat futures dropped below $5.3 per bushel, nearing a three-and-a-half-year low of $5.2 recorded on March 6th, following China's recent cancellation of a wheat purchase, this time involving Australian wheat. Australia has shown increased aggression in their pricing, while Ukraine, despite ongoing conflict, continues to surpass export expectations. This situation further strains global wheat prices, prompting U.S. prices to decline to maintain competitiveness. Additionally, the USDA revised overall U.S. wheat export projections downward to 710 million bushels in March, compared to 725 million bushels in the February report and 750 million bushels last year. Moreover, ending stocks by June of this year are expected to reach 673 million bushels, marking an 18 percent increase from a year ago, adding to concerns about oversupply.
